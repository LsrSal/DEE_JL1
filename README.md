# DEE_JL1
Alternative firmware for JL1 laser engraver boards.

JL1 board used in number of laser engravers, from homonymous machine to number others, unsurprisingly named JL2, JL3 etc. Some are rebranded of the same.
It came with firmware and software with non-standard protocol and not supported by most popular software that speaks laser GRBL dialect of G-code.

Hardware appeared based on ST32F103 and open source code for that platform is avialable.

Intent of thsi projext is to help with freeing JL1 based laser machines from limitaitons of custom protocol and extremely limited software selection.

This project is compiled exclusively from publically avialable sources.
