JL1 firmware for JL1 frame with appropriate defaults. Homing hard coded for home switches at bottom right and exclusively positive work space.
JL4 firmware is for KKMoon (likes JL4 ?) and JL2 frame with home switches at top right. It is identical to JL1, including defaults, with home switches location being the only difference.

COM2 file to make JL1 wireless is Alpha. I did some testing with LaserGRBL in Telnet mode and it appeared to operate exactly as intended. It is based on original V2 and should operated same way. However, the art of software (or lack thereof) is that every time code touched  - It may break. Please report any problem if you encounter any, with this firmware, not with anything else.
